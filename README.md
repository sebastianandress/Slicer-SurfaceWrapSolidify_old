# Surface Wrap Solidify
**Segment Editor Effect for 3D Slicer**

## Introduction
This effect was designed for creating fractured bone models for fast 3D printing. Especially in orthopedic trauma surgery, the editing time, as well as the printing time should be as short as possible. Using this effect helps to fulfil both features. Also, by removing inner cancellous structures, it is possible to achieve a fracture reduction on the printed model.

In our use-case, we used this effect after applying a simple threshold operation and separating the bone with simple brushing and island techniques. Please watch the [workflow example](#Workflow-Example) videos. The effect was tested on more than 30 acetabular fracture models, it reduced the printing time about 70%.

## Description
The Wrap Solidify Effect uses the following pipeline:

1. A surface representation of the selected segment is created (segmented model).
    * _Smoothing Factor_ defines smoothing of the input surface representation
2. Around this segmented model a sphere is created (sphere/surface model).
3. Shrinkwrapping (iteratively shrinking and remeshing the sphere model to the segmented model) is used for surface definition.
    * _Number of Shrinkwrap Iterations_ is used to define the number of iterations.
    * _Smoothing Factor_ is used for smoothing between iterations.
    * _Spacing_ is used to define resolution of remesh.
4. (optional) The resulting surface model is converted into a segmentation.

### Optional Steps

* **Carve out Cavities**:
    1. Three initial shrinking and remeshing iterations ([Step 1-3](#Description)).
        * _Minimal Cavities Diameter_ and _Minimal Cavities Depth_ is used to define cavities (like in the example images the acetabular cup)
    2. Vertices of the surface model get projected into cavities.
    3. Final shrinkwrap iterations ([Step 3-4](#Description)).

* **Create Shell**:
    1. Initial Shrinkwrapping ([Step 1-3](#Description)).
    2. After the shrinkwrapping, all vertices of the surface model, that are not touching the segmented model, are deleted.
        * _Shell to Input Distance_ is used to define maximal allowed distance between the vertices of the surface model and the segmented model.
    3. The surface model gets converted to a solid shell model.
        * _Output Shell Thickness_ is used to define the thickness of this shell.
    4. (optional) [Step 4](#Description).

## Workflow Example

As described in the [Introduction](#Introduction), this effect was designed to create fast printable bones as easy and least time consuming as possible. The parameters are especially fitted for hemipelvic bones. The threshold and manual edit takes about 3 minutes, the effect itself another 2 minutes resulting in an printable bone. The effect itself reduces the printing time about 70 percent.

### Threshold
[![Threshold Video Preview Image](/Resources/Media/threshold.png)](https://1drv.ms/v/s!AqzdGuIdWLfeiNpPJhrVKhDsuxqw7w?e=6DOqgo)

A thresholding operation between 300 and the maximal Houndsfiled Unit was performed, using the __Threshold__ effect. By using the sphere brush, first the femoral head, and subsequently connecting parts in the sacroiliac joint were erased. Using the __Islands__ effect, the exempted hemipelvis was added to an own segment.

### Filter process

In this example, the processing time was 1:46 min on a Apple MacBook Pro 2017 (3,1 GHz Intel Core i7, Memory 16 GB).
